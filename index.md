Apache Tuweni is a set of libraries and other tools to aid development of blockchain and other decentralized software in Java and other JVM languages. It includes a low-level bytes library, serialization and deserialization codecs (e.g. RLP), various cryptography functions and primitives, and lots of other helpful utilities.

To learn how to use Apache Tuweni for low-level libraries, such as bytes, bigints, RLP encoding and so on, [follow this tutorial](/tutorials/libraries).

To learn more about the networking libraries Apache Tuweni supports, [follow along here](/tutorials/networking).
