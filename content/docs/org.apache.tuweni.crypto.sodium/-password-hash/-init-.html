<p>The Argon2 memory-hard hashing function. </p>
<p> Argon2 summarizes the state of the art in the design of memory-hard functions. </p>
<p> It aims at the highest memory filling rate and effective use of multiple computing units, while still providing defense against tradeoff attacks. </p>
<p> It prevents ASICs from having a significant advantage over software implementations. </p>
Guidelines for choosing the parameters 
<p> Start by determining how much memory the function can use. What will be the highest number of threads/processes evaluating the function simultaneously (ideally, no more than 1 per CPU core)? How much physical memory is guaranteed to be available? </p>
<p> Set memlimit to the amount of memory you want to reserve for password hashing. </p>
<p> Then, set opslimit to 3 and measure the time it takes to hash a password. </p>
<p> If this it is way too long for your application, reduce memlimit, but keep opslimit set to 3. </p>
<p> If the function is so fast that you can afford it to be more computationally intensive without any usability issues, increase opslimit. </p>
<p> For online use (e.g. login in on a website), a 1 second computation is likely to be the acceptable maximum. </p>
<p> For interactive use (e.g. a desktop application), a 5 second pause after having entered a password is acceptable if the password doesn't need to be entered more than once per session. </p>
<p> For non-interactive use and infrequent use (e.g. restoring an encrypted backup), an even slower computation can be an option. </p>
<p> This class depends upon the JNR-FFI library being available on the classpath, along with its dependencies. See https://github.com/jnr/jnr-ffi. JNR-FFI can be included using the gradle dependency 'com.github.jnr:jnr-ffi'.</p>
